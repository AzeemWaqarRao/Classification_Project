- Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to execute the script:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

## Sample Data
The sample data used in this project is stored in the data dictionary within the script. It consists of measurements of petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species of the iris flowers.

## Acknowledgements
The dataset used in this project is for demonstration purposes and has been self-generated.<br />
